## About

An object-oriented game engine written in Python3 depending on pygame2 named after the iconic Touhou character, Sakuya. This game engine was originally made for bullet hell games, but now is focused on other genres as well.

This engine supports Scene Management, Advanced Bullet Management, Primitive Particles, an Advanced Clock System, Lights, etc.

## Installation
```
pip install .
```

## Questions & Answers
1. Can I use this for my game?

Go for it, although there is no documentation and method names will be changing from time to time. I only recommend you use this as a reference. Please credit me if you're going to copy and paste it in your game.

2. Why Sakuya?

She's my favorite Touhou character and seeing that this engine was made for bullet hells, I found the name very fitting.

3. Can SakuyaEngine work with Pyglet or Arcade?

No, and it never will.

4. Will SakuyaEngine be uploaded to PyPi?

I don't think it belongs on PyPi, as this engine is completely built ontop of pygame. I'll have to think about it.
