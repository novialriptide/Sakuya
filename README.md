## About
Named after the iconic Touhou character, Sakuya Izayoi (十六夜　咲夜),
SakuyaEngine is an object-oriented game engine that supports scene, sound, and entity management.
It inherits a lot of features from its predecessor, 
[GameDen](https://github.com/novialriptide/GameDen), but has been improved in
many ways.

## Questions & Answers
1. Can I use this for my game?

Go for it, although there is no documentation and method names will be changing from time to time. I only recommend you use this as a reference. Please credit me if you're going to copy and paste it in your game.

2. Why Sakuya?

She's my favorite Touhou character and seeing that this engine was made for bullet hells, I found the name very fitting.

3. Can SakuyaEngine work with Pyglet or Arcade?

No, and it never will.

4. Will SakuyaEngine be uploaded to PyPi?

I don't think it belongs on PyPi, as this engine is completely built ontop of pygame. I'll have to think about it.
